# Enroll Me Market

Enroll Me Market is an extension to an existing application (Enroll-Me), which serves students to find an optimal classes timetable, based on their preferences.
However, once you get your timetable, you might not be fully satisfied with it. But maybe there is someone you could swap your terms with, making both of you happy?

That is where we come in! A students' representative can download the timetables of a group of students as a CSV file from Enroll-Me and upload in to the Market. Then everyone can mark which classes they would like to give away and which ones they could get in exchange.
As soon as we find a matching pair of students, we perform an exchange between them. A summary of successful swaps can then be downloaded by the students' representative.
